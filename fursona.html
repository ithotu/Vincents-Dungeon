    <h2>Who is Vincent?</h2>
    <p>Vincent is a Tuxedo cat. A former stray, Vincent now lives a comfortable life as a housepet to his kind master.</p>
    <p>Vincent is known to be somewhat neurotic due to his time as a stray, and needs a lot of emotional support. He tries to channel this into creative energy most of the time.</p>
    <p>His favourite things include horror movies, entomology, art history, and belly rubs.</p>
    <h2>What does Vincent look like?</h2>
    <p>Vincent has black fur all over, except for the distinct Tuxedo white markings around his mouth and up the bridge of his nose. He also has white fur that goes down his chest. He's very fluffy. He's notably short, only reaching about 5 feet in height.</p>
    <p>Vincent has several scars, most of them small cuts and scrapes from his years as an outdoor cat.</p>
    <p>Vincent has grey-blue eyes and a pink nose with pink toebeans.</p>
    <p>He is very rarely ever seen without his collar, which is black but has a light blue fur lining. It has a silver tag, the front of which has his name, and the back of which has his owner's contact information.</p>
    <p>He has very sad eyes, making many people think that he's upset when he's not. </p>
