    <p>It's been a while! Turns out, school likes to kick my ass and take out any and all motivation to do things besides sleep and do schoolwork. My semester is over though, so here's a long overdue life update. It's been two months and a day since my last update, so for ease of writing, I'm going to divide this blog post up into some general sections based on what I've been up to.</p>
    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>This upcoming semester is my last semester of undergrad, which is a bizarre feeling. I'm going to be going into graduate school, probably hopefully, but I still feel strange about everything. Nonetheless, let's focus on the past rather than the future for this moment.</p>
    <p>School was difficult. It tends to be, as someone with ADHD that I don't manage as well as I could, but this semester felt especially hard. Got hit hard with depression and burnout, I think. I had one class that was particularly fucking obnoxious, if only because the professor never posted grades. I feel like there should be a rule that professors have to give me access to my grades without me having to ask. He was kind of a dick in emails so I tried not to email him much.</p>
    <p>Got good grades on all my finals though, so I'm not too worried about that. I did a lot of my finals fairly last minute so I'm pleased that I managed to get some good scores.</p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>Work has been pretty good, actually. I didn't get that job I was hoping for, which sucked, but I have really good bosses. My supervisor and I cried together and hugged because she said a bunch of nice shit about me. I got a review within the past few days as well and that turned out good. I'm very appreciated.</p>
    <p>My hours got cut for next semester though, which I'm peeved about. Not an issue with my work but more of a budget issue with the university, apparently. Dunno the full sitaution, but it sucks since I've started to actually build up a nice chunk of money for myself. Just gonna keep saving.</p>
    <p>My coworkers have been annoying me a bit too, but that's par for the course I guess. I don't hate anyone, just some minor things.</p>
    <h2>Fun</h2>
    <p>I've had a deep, embarrassing obsession with Pokemon the past while. I haven't even gotten Scarlet and/or Violet (still waiting for them to patch that fucking nightmare) but I have been replaying some old games. Been trying to get into Nuzlocking, but it's a pain in my left nut. I'm not 'good' at Pokemon, I care more about the collection aspect, but it is still fun to keep throwing myself at the wall sometimes. Took a break after the semester ended from Nuzlocking to just fuck around in games but going to start that up again soon. Really want to continue this Emerald one I was doing, since I've never actually played a Gen 3 game before. I know, sacriliege.</p>
    <p>The whole Scarlet/Violet thing has deeply disappointed me, not going to lie. I know that Gamefreak is notorious for this, but this is the worst game that they've ever put out, but it's also clear that a lot of people really like the ideas that they explore within it. I want to like it. I know Pokemon is a marketing machine, but I can't really remove myself from how much the series means to me since I've been involved with it my whole life. It just really sucks that they put out a game this genuinely unfinished and bad and expect people to pay full price for it. Pay for it at all, really. I hope they patch it or something, because even if I end up not buying it, I at least want the people who essentially got scammed to have a better time with it.</p>
    <p>Been playing Minecraft too, trying to get back into the Hardcore grind. I'm finding that the parts I find the most frustrating with Minecraft are the mining and building parts. I kinda wish I could just make a house out of thin air and start in that rather than having to fuck around with building since I just find it tedious. Close to having a house built in my latest world though, so let's hope that I don't just immediately get sniped by a skeleton as tends to be the end for all of my hardcore worlds.</p>
    <p>I got two new tarantulas as well, a Mexican Red Rump named Barb and a G. Pulchra named Judith. They're very tiny at the moment. Also got my oldest tarantula, Evelyn, a giant cage upgrade. She's ballin', stupid manthing.</p>
    <h2>Nerd Shit</h2>
    <p>I'm finally going to try a tiling WM. I'm going to do it and no one can stop me.</p>
    <p>Still a bit scared to try editing dotfiles myself though, might just steal some from github and edit them a tiny bit at a time to get them <em>exactly</em> how I want them.</p>
    <p>Also trying to learn vim. Vimboficiation is, in fact, in motion.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Anyways, that's it for this update. Smaller than I expected but life really has been just papers and stress. Hope I can talk more as I settle into being on break. See you soon!</p>
