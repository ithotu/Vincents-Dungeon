    <p>This is my first official blog post, though it may be a few days before my website actually goes up. In general, my day was fairly boring. Work was incredibly slow and I ended up dipping about half an hour early because I was going stir crazy. </p>
    <p>I'm excited for my weekend though (I don't have class or work on Fridays, lucky me!). Probably going to take the time to read and work on this website more after I clean on Friday. I <i>really</i> need to clean my room, it's a bit of a pig sty at the moment.</p>
    <p>I also have some final papers to work on that I will make sure to work on this weekend so I'm at least a little bit caught up. I'm not too worried about finals, they'll be easy since they're all based on previous works in the classes but they're pretty long assignments. </p>
