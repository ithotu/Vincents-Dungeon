    <p>Been a bit of a pain in the ass to get this working, but here we are.</p>
    <p>I tried all sorts of static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo, but honestly, I just prefer using my own template.</p>
    <p>I was just getting tired of zonelets, I found it a bit clunky to work with sometimes. Maybe I can steal some code/ideas from that to make this blog work better though.</p>
    <p>For now, though, here we are.</p>
    <p>Site is officially switched over to the new host, and here I am.</p>
    <p>Life has been weird for me lately. Haven't been feeling great emotionally, but have some good stuff going on. I have a major job interview this Friday, which makes me excited and anxious all at once. I'm just glad I got to the interview stage at all, to be honest. That's all I'm going to say, as not to jinx it.</p>
    <p>What else? Honestly, not much. Been pretty boring. Works been slow as hell. Internet was off all day so we just fucked around. I've been slacking a lot at work, need to get better about that.</p>
    <p>I got Project Diva Megamix +. Is that news? It is now. Fun, but the keyboard controls are fucking jank. Need to get used to them at some point though.</p>
