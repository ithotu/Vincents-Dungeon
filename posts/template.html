    <p>Had my first week of classes last week. Pretty boring, not much to talk about. I have good classes, work is probably going to be boring, you know how it is.</p>
    <p>I also managed to get fucking sick after spending only three days on campus.</p>
    <p>Womp womp.</p>
    <p>So, I've spent the entirety of the third week of January 2023 sick. It hasn't been too miserable, just a minor sinus infection, but still draining enough that I have just been laying in bed kind of pitiful for the entire week. Above all else, I've been painfully bored. Video games have been a bit out of my grasp because they require brain power I don't have. I've read a little bit, which has been good, but otherwise it has been a lot of napping and chatting on Discord.</p>
    <p>Been moderating, too. I have my write-up for my time moderating for the Yesterweb discord in the wake of the announcement that the Discord will be shut down. I will likely punch that up and post that within the next few days.</p>
    <p>I have to say though, the forums are definitely much nicer just in terms of pace. It's nice to not feel like you're constantly missing out on something. I missed forums a lot, and I have some ideas brewing for a roleplay forum. Unfortunately, getting sick put a pin in that, but I will get back to working condition and start working on that again. Keep an eye out if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
    <p>Short post today, though. I've genuinely just been laying on the couch staring at the ceiling all week. Let's hope the next week is better.</p>
