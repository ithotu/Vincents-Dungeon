    <p>I've been struggling a lot with maintaining a website.</p>
    <p>This may seem counter-intuitive to the fact that I've been constantly updating and posting probably more often than I ever have, but it's been getting harder and harder. I try to make pages quickly, these days. Otherwise, I will never publish something. I struggle a lot with perfectionism, always have, and have always operated under the mentality that I'd rather not publish something if it has any flaws.</p>
    <p>This website has been an effort to move away from that mentality, to just create a space where I throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. I make pages in an hour or two and upload them because the information that I want on them is there, and they're at least semi-functional.</p>
    <p>Recently, though, I've been feeling very self conscious about this aspect of my webspace. It seems like I am surrounded by well-manicured websites that are much flashier and better designed than my own.</p>
    <p>This is not a dig at those people. I'm happy for them. It just also makes me self conscious in a way that I haven't experienced in a long time.</p>
    <p>I just feel less than, I guess. I feel like I am doing this wrong.</p>
    <p>This is more of a quick vent than anything, I guess. Just feeling like re-doing my entire website again. Is it ever enough for me, though?</p>
