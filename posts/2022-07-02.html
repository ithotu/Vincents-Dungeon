        <p>TW: DEATH</p></div>
        <p>Just a small life update.</p>
        <p>My grandmother died today. I'm doing okay, as is the parent whose mother it is. Things are difficult, of course, but everyone seems to be handling it well. As expected, I feel a little bit numb to the whole thing still.</p>
        <p>Thank you to those who left kind comments on my last post about this as well as talking to me privately. I greatly appreciate your support.</p>
        <p>The next few days may be strange. There's a lot of things I associate with her. She loved nature, gardening, flowers, birds, etc: Things you may notice I've been engaged in a lot. I don't want to necessarily say that these things are in her honor: She was a complicated person, we all are, and I'm not one to unnecessarily venerate someone after death. However, it does feel like it's a good way to connect with those parts of her that brought good memories to those around her.</p>
        <p>Regardless of my closeness to my grandmother, a loss is a loss. It still weighs heavy on everyone involved.</p>
        <p>I just hope that I can provide some support and relief to those who are hurting more than me.</p>
