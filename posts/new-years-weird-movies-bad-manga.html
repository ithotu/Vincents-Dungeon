    <h2>NEW YEARS</h2>
    <p>I'm still the type of person who does New Years resolutions every year, though I rarely follow through. Maybe this year. Here's a list, though:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop drinking sugary drinks/soda</li>
      <li>Start creating art again</li>
      <li>Read more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I try to keep my resolutions fairly lowkey in order to not stress myself out with lofty goals. I don't need to be good at art by the end of the year - just practice more. I don't need to read 100 books, just more than 0. Let's see how this works out. I'll keep you updated.</p>
    <h2>WEIRD MOVIES</h2>
    <p>For New Years, I just watched some movies with my mom. We're not particularly holiday people. Here's the films I watched, with some thoughts.</p>
    <p><b>PEARL - 2022</b></p>
    <p>Pearl is the sequel to the film X, a movie that I happened to quite like for what it was which was a sort of love letter to sleazy exploitation horror. Pearl is a bit weirder with it, more of a psychological drama than anything but still rather over the top. Overall, I found it really enjoyable. I rolled my eyes when I learned that this movie was going to be A Thing after I watched X, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually really good. Mia Goth is a very good actress, I'm excited to see what else she gets up to after this.</p>
    <p><b>MEN - 2022</b></p>
    <p>Men is a movie by Alex Garland, who made Annihilation and Ex Machina. This is the first movie I've seen by him though, because I am bad at watching movies. I still have no idea how I feel about this film. It was a bit of a fucking trip, really weird and upsetting but in a way that I enjoy from film. Overall, I think I liked it? The ending was weird in a way that bordered on too self indulgent, but I recommend if if you're able to stomach weird shit. The plot has a lot to do with misogyny, though, so just a heads up that it's a rough one.</p>
    <h2>BAD MANGA</h2>
    <p>This is a long time coming, something I've wanted to write a full blog post for and still might but I have some feelings about some really shitty manga that I've read over the past few years. For reference, I just scroll Mangadex mindlessly and generally try to find things that fit into one of two categories: Actually Good, or Funny Bad. I don't like boring bad. I don't like mediocre. If I want something to be shitty, I want it to be so shitty it changes my life. Here are some manga that at least close to reaching that, or reached that but then kept going too long, which is basically most manga.</p>
    <p>As a note, I'm just going to put a blanket trigger warning on all of these manga for like, everything. I read a lot of horror manga and for shitty writers, that means sexual assault every 10 pages for cheap shock value. You have been warned! I don't condone anything in these manga, I read them because I think they're dogshit.</p>
    <p><b>HIMENOSPIA/ARACHNID/BLATTODEA</b></p>
    <p>A manga psuedo-series that I mentally refer to as "the bug fetish manga". </p>
    <p>So, author Murata Shinya really fucking likes a few things: rape, and bugs. And holy shit, does he write a lot about these two subjects. Himenospia, Arachnid, and Blattodea all take place in universes where a bunch of teenage girls have powers related to insects. Arachnid and Blattodea are directly related to each other as Blattodea is a sequel, and Arachnid might be the first in this strange little series that Shinya has created. I say this because it is the closest to a real manga for the first few chapters before it goes batshit insane, and the rest just start out as fucking insane. </p>
    <p>Here's the gist of like, all of the stories: Some girl gets abused by people in her life, she gets bug powers, and then weird plots happen. Himenospia is probably my 'favourite' if only because it goes balls to the wall pretty early and doesn't get as boring or drawn out as Arachnid does. Blattodea is still in progress, so I can't comment on that one much.</p>
    <p>Himenospia has it all - wasp related mind control, lesbianism, anime depictions of Donald Trump being stepped on by a dominatrix, etc. Main girl Endou Himeno gets bullied at school and gets abused by her mother, until one day she gets stung by a wasp that gives her a stinger that comes out of... I think her pussy? Pretty sure it's her pussy. Anyways, this stinger lets her mind control people and turn them into drones, and then she starts trying to take over the world or something. It gets pretty incomprehensible at points, as does all of Shinya's manga, but I still recommend it if you can stomach the yikesy shit and just read it for what ti is - someone really wants to fuck teenage bug girls. </p>
    <p><b>DEAD TUBE</b></p>
    <p>Dead Tube follows a guy named Machiya, a teenager who is part of a film club in  high school and likes directing videos. After he gets involved with a murderer who has him film her murders, he learns about Dead Tube, a youtube clone where you get prizes based on how many views your videos get - and the more disturbing, the more views.</p>
    <p>The first chapter of this one is actually kinda interesting, which is what makes it very quickly slipping off the rails into a shitshow somewhat disappointing. It seems like it'll be at least somewhat interested in psychological horror, but nah, it turns into a farce by chapter 2. There's like, multiple murder themed tournament arcs in this shit. Really, what kept me reading was just the insane plots as well as the gore which is fun to look at. One of the more amusing elements of the plot is that Dead Tube is like, insanely popular and it's just something we have to accept about this universe. It's like liveleak but you're expected to actually do the murders yourself most of the time.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure if I would recommend Dead Tube if only because it gets pretty fucking boring and repetitive pretty early. The main characters are bland as hell too, you have Murder Yandere Girl and Guy Who Beats It To Liveleak. Not anything I find particularly compelling, but if you like splatter films and can turn your brain off, it may be worth reading.</p>
    <p><b>A Slave Harem in The Fantasy World Dungeon</b></p>
    <p>I'm ashamed to admit that I read this and knew about this long before the anime adaptation was announced. If you look for the anime adaptation, you may notice a very important word missing from the title - slave.</p>
    <p>I don't know why, frankly, because it is a fairly standard Isekai trope - a guy travels to another world, is very okay with slavery for some reason, and purchases a bunch of big tiddy anime girls to adventure with. It's sleazy. It's basically just porn. However, what frustrates me the most is that there are actually some fairly interesting isekai ideas going on here? The whole class system and the way you can rank classes and change XP gains and shit is actually somewhat neat, but they can't explore that too much because the main character has to fuck his slave girls like, a lot. So much. Once every few chapters is just an elongated sex scene where they gush (teehee) about how sexy he is and shit. He's generic as fuck as a protagonist, not particularly surprising considering that this is an isekai manga, but still.</p>
    <p>Why do I read this, you may ask? Frankly, I don't know. I'm up to date with this dogshit and I don't know why. So, do I recommend it. I guess? I guess there's something here keeping me reading. Maybe it's the brief glimpses of interesting fantasy you get in between the general malaise you feel at the whole slavery aspect.</p>
    <h2>FUTURE IDEAS</h2>
    <p>Here's some stuff I want to work on for the site in the future.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A blog post about moderating the Yesterweb, my views on the movement, and the ideas I have for the future.</li>
      <li>A linux page, includes some screenshots of my desktop set ups, some must-have programs, etc.</li>
      <li>More writing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will probably have more, but I am exhausted at current moment and cannot form real thoughts. Hope I can actually work on some of these though. A site redesign is also being floated around in my head, but I'm not sure how necessary it is right now.</p>
