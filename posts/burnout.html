    <p>I am worn the fuck out.</p>
    <p>It's not even anything in particular this time. School. Work. Life. It's all just weighing down.</p>
    <p>It's one of those periods of time where the entire world seems to be covered in a grey cloud. I'm tired. I'm depressed. I haven't felt this bad in a while. I'm going, that's all I can say. Not much good news to report, though.</p>
    <p>Bit of a downer of a diary post, and I'm sorry for that (to the very few that will probably ever read this), just need to get some feelings out I guess. The weight on my chest will go away one day. I will breathe again. For now, though, its unfortunately further out than I would like.</p>
    <p>Some good things. I have friends I like talking to. I have a job that pays pretty well. I have two cats and a tarantula I adore. I'm doing better than I thought I would at this age.</p>
    <p>I wish I had any particular stories, but I don't. At least, if I did, I forgot whatever anecdotes I was going to tell. People are kind of annoying me overall, but I know a lot of it is just my pissy mood. The other part is definitely the fact that people are, in general, just annoying though.</p>
    <p>Kinda just want a hug to be honest.</p>
    <p>Some other small notes and random thoughts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Still want to start roleplaying again. Still afraid to tell people the plots I want to roleplay. Not even that degenerate, just embarrassing and self indulgent.</li>
        <li>I hate that Mary on a Cross and Ghost in general got big on Tiktok. Keep seeing stupid takes.</li>
        <li>Like a cicada that emerges from the ground every year, one of my special interests has made a resurgance as it does every year in October: Halloween animatronics. Good vids this year, excited to see even more.</li>
        <li>I'm starting to semi Git Gud at Binding of Isaac. Not much.</li>
        <li>It's getting pleasantly cold again, and I got my comforter out of my closet. Time to get very sleepy cozy at night and imagine myself as... nevermind.</li>
        <li>Still want to find a nice Otherkin community, still fucking terrified of Otherkin communities.</li>
        <li>Our Flag Means Death has some solid fanfic out there. Keeping me sane.</li>
        <li>I think I'd be about three percent more normal if I could call people cunts to their face.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>T-t-t-that's all. folks. Hope everyone is having a better time than I am, and if not, we're going to get through this together.</p>
