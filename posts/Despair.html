    <p>At time of writing this, a malaise that has settled over me in the past few months has only solidified.</p>
    <p>Rising hatred towards LGBT+ people, the overturning of Roe V. Wade, the overwhelming rise in right-wing extremism, it's hard to have any sense of hope in the world sometimes.</p>
    <p>I don't know what else to say. I don't know how you stay optimistic or even manage to still have energy to keep fighting. It's so exhausting. It's depressing and horrific to think about the people whose lives have been lost, whose lives will be lost, whose lives will be ruined by the current direction that the country is going.</p>
    <p>I go on social media to see if anyone has any way to make this feel better, to see if anyone else has crawled out of the despair that I feel, but instead I see gimmick accounts posting their t-shirts next to performative posts about fascism. It disgusts me. People have no sense of morals. People have no sense of empathy or care in other people.</p>
    <p>I want to go back into the closet. I want to lay down and stop trying. I hope things get better.</p>
    <p>Sorry for the depressing post. I wish I could end this on a note about staying strong, but that feels impossible at the moment.</p>
    <p>Stay safe, and please don't lose your love and compassion for one another. </p>
