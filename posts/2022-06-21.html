    <p>Some various thoughts throughout this week, thus far.</p>
    <p>Been really anxious lately, not a huge fan of that. I'm not even sure what's causing it? I've been taking my medication and, in general, have been practicing mindfulness and working on my mental health more than usual. Not entirely sure what's up. Maybe I'm possessed?</p>
    <p>Really enjoying nature photography, thuogh the anxiety makes it very difficult for me to like my photos. I think I've taken some good ones, but I need to keep reminding myself that I'm a beginner working with a very cheap, shitty lens that clips onto my iPhone. Either way, really enjoying birding. Plan on writing an article about that later. It's been relaxing.</p>
    <p>I got Elden Ring but have spent more time playing fucking Roblox than that. Game's stressful and I'm at a point where I'm not far enough to want to keep going with this very very shitty playthrough but also far enough that it feels just pointless. I should just keep working on it. I will once I'm less stressed out in general.</p>
    <p>Roblox is oddly fun, though. Nice "numbers go up" sort of games that are mindless to play but good for listening to a youtube video or something while I decompress.</p>
    <p>Some family stuff has happened that sucks a lot. Not going to go into much detail, but just icing on the shit cake. You know how it is.</p>
    <p>Trying to read more. Read <i>Johnny Got His Gun</i> by Dalton Trumbo. Depressing book. Might re-read House of Leaves.</p>
    <p>Appreciate my friends a lot. Keeping me sane right now. Thank you, Jay, for listening to my stupid gay ranting about self-shipping.</p>
    <p>Speaking of which, that's the next page I'm working on. Going to take a while. Not sure how gay and/or honest I want to be about it. Ahh!</p>
