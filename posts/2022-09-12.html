    <p>Brief life update.</p>

<p>Things have been going at school. Not well, but not badly. Just trying to get back into the swing of things. Most of all, trying to get my shit together with school work. I have a free day every week, thursday: Might take this thursday to actually catch up on things and try to even get ahead with some assignments.</p>

<p>I've just been exhausted every day and have no intention of doing things after work/school. Tuesdays, I'm on campus until 7 pm essentially. Almost 12 hour day. No way I'm working after that. So I need to start scheduling my time better. Also might need to cut back on the caffeine dependency: I think the crashes are really beating my ass.</p>

<p>I've been watching a shit ton of Impactical Jokers. I don't know why I like it so much. Generally not into this kinda shit, but... It's comforting. Like a cheeseburger in show form.</p>

<p>I wish I could say more, but I've just been going through the motions. Not a bad thing, though. I'll start settling once we get a little bit further into the semester. Less than a month isn't really enough time to adjust to the new schedule after months of not doing shit, I feel like.</p>

<p>Anyways, have some big goals. Want to change my site hosting, but unsure if I should do that before or after I invest in a raspberry pi setup. Probably after. Hope to start self hosting a lot of stuff soon. Wish me luck!</p>
