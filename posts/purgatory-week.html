  <h1 class="title">Purgatory Week and Other Stories</h1>
  <h3 class="date">September 24th, 2022</h3>
  <hr />
  <div class="content">
    <p>Purgatory week refers to the fact that I wanted to call this 'Hell Week' then realized that it wasn't bad - pretty good, actually - and more just a lot of shit going on. So. Purgatory week. Somewhere between heaven and hell.</p>
    <p>Anyways, I had my job interview yesterday. I feel like I did pretty good, honestly! Not too bad, at least. It was weird, applying for the place I technically already work at, but I hope that gives me an edge since my boss already knows my skills and work ethic.</p>
    <p>There was a party at work this week too, a retirement party for one of my supervisors. It was pretty fun. She's not gone yet, won't be for a while, but it was still sweet. I had to help set everything up, chairs and tables and that, so I've kinda had a twinge in my back all week since doing that. Oh well. It was rewarding and I've gotten a bunch of free food out of it. Really what matters in the end, isn't it?</p>
    <p>Kidding... Maybe.</p>
    <p>I haven't had much time to just work on the website or anything, I've been pretty consistently busy this week. Need to redo my Halloween page, in fact, so might do that this weekend.</p>
    <p>I've just kinda been too tired to really do much outside of work and class, which sucks, but I think it should be better after this week. At least temporarily. School's been a bit of a struggle, but it's mostly the online classes, as per usual. Just not great if you have ADHD.</p>
    <p>I always feel a little boring in these blog updates. Maybe I should become some sort of hot take machine, but not really my vibe anymore I guess, at least not publicly. I dunno, something to think about I guess. I could start doing more kinda researched articles but it does feel like I'm giving myself homework that just allows me to  procrastinate the homework that decides if I get into graduate school.</p>
    <p>On that note, I'm going to leave you all with an article to read (now with video form!): <a href="https://crowdefeatsbooks.wordpress.com/2022/09/16/tiktok-sensation-lightlark-is-the-final-boss-of-bad-fantasy-ya-a-failure-built-on-aesthetic-boards-and-tropes-unable-to-pretend-it-has-a-heart/">Lightlark is the Final Boss of Bad Fantasy YA.</a></p>
    <p>I'm not going to give you more than just the title. Read it. It's delightful.</p>
