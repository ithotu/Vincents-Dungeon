    <p>I turn 21 years old in 6 days. I'm not very impressed by this birthday, though. My mom keeps saying its a big birthday, but as someone who doesn't want to drink, I don't find myself as excited for it as I did turning 18 or 20.</p>
    <p>I'm not that much of a debbie downer about it, though. I'm still excited to spend time with my family and see what presents I get. Even if the age doesn't mean much, the experiences I have on that day might.</p>
    <p>Honestly, though, my malaise might just be because I'm exhausted. After I finished and turned in all my essays, the fumes I had been running on for the past few weeks/almost a month ran out and I was left a goopy little ball of a man. Mostly spending time in bed and working on the website, but I don't consider that time wasted. After a very busy semester with a lot of work and school, I'm allowing myself to take a break and just chill for a while.</p>
    <p>Other than some work this week and my birthday, I don't have many solid plans yet. I want to clean my room first and foremost, and then I'll see about going to the park so I can start birdwatching. I got some binoculars and a nice messenger bag so I can carry some stuff with me. It sounds like a relaxing hobby, and goes well with my obsession with flipping over rocks and looking at bugs. Basically the same thing, just in the air.</p>
    <p>The next big project for the site though is my review of The Walten Files. I kind of tear it apart and while I have like, 1 1/2 drafts done, I'm considering scrapping it and maybe going for something that feels less smarmy. I know that it's my site and I can do what I want, but I still don't want to be a dick for no reason, especially towards something a lot of people like.</p>
    <p>Anyways, that's all for my updates. Pretty boring, I know. See you soon!</p>
